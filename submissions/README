This package contains document templates for the Linux Audio
Conference 2012 (LAC2012, see http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2012).
For the reviewing process, we expect paper submissions in PDF.
Please make use of one of the following templates:

- OpenOffice/LibreOffice document
- LaTeX document

For the layout process of the proceedings, we might ask for the source
materials (text, images, etc.) of the accepted papers later.

Usage instructions:

- For the OpenOffice template: Just use it, mostly intuitively.
  When finished, export the document to PDF and send that.

- For the LaTeX templates:
  - Write down your paper text as usual
  - If you make references, put authors into file sample.bib
  - Run "pdflatex <yourfile>"
  - Run "bibtex <yourfile>"
  - Run "pdflatex <yourfile>" _two_ more times so that all references to
    the bibliography data can be resolved
  - Send in the pdf file

We include some pdf examples along with the latex source files (for 1
author, 2 authors...).

If you cannot produce PDF using one of these templates, please contact
us via email to: lac at linuxaudio dot org

Both templates are slightly modified copies of the templates provided
by the International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling).
Many thanks to Coling for their permission to use them!
