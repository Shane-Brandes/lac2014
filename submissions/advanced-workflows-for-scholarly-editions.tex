\begin{abstract}
\begin{contentsmall}
Plain text based tools and version control offer unique and fundamental advantages over
graphical approaches when preparing scholarly editions.
But it is difficult to convince musicologists, engravers and publishers getting their hands
dirty with source code.

This paper presents our experiences with two complex edition projects and outlines
how we are striving towards an ideal working environment by extending our favorite tools LilyPond
and LaTeX with specific solutions.
