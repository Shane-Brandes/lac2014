This paper reconsiders the “Arranger Window” concept of \textsc{daw} programs from the perspective of recording classical music.
I will present a new concept of recording classical music with the main concern being the organization of the recorded material and the preparation of an editing plan.
For this I will outline some ideas of a possible approach towards designing a software application.

Specific stress is put on plain text storage and the use of version control for project management, offering perspectives for collaborative workflows.

\section{Introduction}

As a technically inclined musician I have always been interested in recording processes, from pubertal experiments on a four-track tape deck until today where music production on the computer is ubiquitous.
But in recent years I had the opportunity and reason to reflect on the workflows imposed by the usual \textsc{daw} tools in a more substantial way.
As a pianist I could produce a consideral number of professional recordings, totalling in eight CDs, recorded in more than 30 studio days over several years.
The recording producers entrusted me with the complete recordings along with their annotated scores so I could judge the first edits and express my wishes and suggestions for improvements very concisely. 
For some of the recordings I actually did the first edits myself with \emph{Ardour}.
This way I had around 70 hours of recorded material to sort, evaluate and process.
This experience convinced me that the fundamental concepts of today's \textsc{daw} programs are really designed for producing \emph{pop} music.

In this paper I'm going to outline a new approach to the task of managing recorded material from the perspective of recording \emph{classical} music.
The central idea is to shift focus from a fixed time-line in an \emph{Arranger Window} to the concept of self-contained \emph{Takes} that are aware of their content instead of only their length.
I'll outline ideas how these new ideas could be reflected in a \textsc{gui} application, although I currently don't have (or rather can't afford) any implementation plans.
The issue I don't have a definite opinion about is to which extent such an application could/should be aimed at being a \emph{replacement} for existing tools or how it could be \emph{integrated} in an efficient toolchain.

By sharing these ideas publicly I'm hoping for interesting insights and feedback, and maybe this discussion can motivate people to seriously think about making use of them.
And given enough interest from people with the necessary complementary skills I might even be talked into starting a new project.

\section{Two Recording Paradigms}

Of course there are more shades to the matter  than simply speaking of “pop” and “classical” music.
And of course there is a variety of approaches how to produce recordings that don't match the black \& white labeling suggested by such a separation.
So please bear with me if I'm occasionally over-generalizing things.
But I think there basically are two main paradigms of recording music, and for simplicity's sake I will call them the \emph{pop} and the \emph{classical} approach in this paper.

\subsection{Recording Pop Music and the Multi-Track Tape Metaphor}

The \emph{pop} approach is based on the metaphor of a multi-track magnetic tape, reflected by an \emph{Arranger Window} in virtually all \textsc{daw} programs I know of.
The tape reel is mapped to a \emph{timeline}, and each new “take” is recorded to an absolute position on it, adding to or replacing anything that has already been recorded.
Different layers (voices/instruments) of the arrangement can be recorded sequentially as “overdubs” on multiple “tracks” representing those on the vintage tape.
We can move takes around or copy, multiply and edit them, but everything takes place in the context of the fixed timeline.

\subsection{Recording Classical Music}
 
By contrast the \emph{classical} approach imitates a (stereo) magnetic tape treated with scissors and adhesive tape.
The complete arrangement is played simultaneously and recorded to one track, without overdubs.
Instead of selecting from the available \emph{parallel} takes the editor extracts selections from the takes and glues them together \emph{consecutively}, creating a seemingly continuous recording.

While this process results in a series of segments on a horizontal timeline too, there are significant differences to the previously described set-up.
In particular the timeline doesn't have a predefined structure but will be the \emph{result} of the final arrangement of takes.
This implies that the absolute position of any given track is only defined at the end of the editing process.
As a result the editor has to ensure that any given edit doesn't have negative side-effects on later parts of the production.
Of course today's tools offer assistance with these problems, but the conceptual issue remains.

Another difference is that \emph{conceptually} we don't have a vertical stack of tracks but only one%
\footnote{Of course the source material will be recorded to discrete tracks on disk, but from a user's perspective it's only one track in most situations.}.
The presence of multiple tracks that \textsc{daw}s offer is actually a waste of screen estate for the recording producer of classical music.
While she usually \emph{does} use these tracks as a kind of stash to experiment with alternative takes for a given spot I will show that this task can be addresses in a completely different manner.

Reality proves that it \emph{is} perfectly possible to produce classical recordings with tools adhering to the pop paradigm.
But it just isn't a really natural approach, and there could be fundamental improvements to the way we conceive this specific task. 

\section{A New Approach to Managing Recorded Material}

While preparing an editing plan the task of a recording producer boils down to keeping track of recorded takes and choosing the best take for each section of the composition.
If the recording session has been complicated this house-keeping can be a tedious and error-prone process.
Usually the recording session yields an annotated score with entries for take starts and usually (but not equally reliably) also where takes end.
Additionally the recording producer will make notes about good or bad takes, problematic or particularly good spots in individual takes, and sometimes also suggestions about concrete transitions between takes.

If the recording session has been easy it can be a straightforward process to create an editing plan from that.
But if it left the producer with a three-figure number of takes it's very tedious (to say the least) to \emph{reliably} look up usable takes for any given measure from such a score.
First of all she has to determine \emph{all} takes covering the range in question, which can be cumbersome because she has to ensure not to miss anything which started earlier.
Then it's crucial to have the takes evaluated and this evaluation to be documented properly -- in order to avoid having to listen to the takes over and over again.
But even this will merely give pointers to the takes as a whole -- while navigating to them to find the actual position of the given musical moment is still up to the user.

So the fundamental idea of my proposed new concept is:
If we're going to document our material anyway, why don't we simultaneously “teach” the takes about themselves?
In the following sections I'll elaborate on this conceptual layer, leaving out ideas for concrete implementations for a later chapter.

\subsection{Takes Know About Their Content}

The core idea of this paper's approach to recording classical music is making the takes completely aware of their musical content and the editor's rating.
In order to achieve this I suggest a switch of perspective and not to deal with \emph{Regions} as parts of recorded audio files but rather with \emph{Takes} as parts of the composition.
For the whole process of analyzing and evaluating the recorded material we don't need the arranger window with its fixed timeline at all.
By contrast we're only interested in the selection and ordering of takes as well as in determining usable transitions between them.
Instead of \emph{placing} regions on a timeline we're going to \emph{chain} takes and define their transitions.
Therefore our focus (and that of a new application) will be on working with individual takes.

As a consequence we also require our project to be aware of the composition, which is an additional layer and therefore some overhead the producer has to maintain.
But I'm sure this investment instantly pays off and isn't a real issue.
To get started with a project the basic requirement is to provide not more than the total number of measures%
\footnote{Or any other unit or numbering scheme, e.\,g.\ rehearsal marks, systems or pages.}.
The producer will refine the representation of the musical structure along the way -- while doing the housekeeping she has to do anyway.

With each added piece of information the project will inherently learn about the composition.
And with that knowledge it will increasingly be able to assist the producer in managing the recorded material.

\subsection{Annotating Takes}
Traditionally the producer documents the material in some sort of list, on paper or in a (text or spreadsheet) document.
Instead of this I suggest to implement dedicated \emph{Take} objects that contain all relevant information about a take.

The fundamental data a take object has to know is the covered range in musical terms, along with a reference to the audio file it is contained in.
This is all the producer has to provide for all takes to get started with a project, so the new approach won't actually impose any significant overhead to the user.
We can further narrow this down by storing the \emph{usable} recorded range (as opposed to the total range), along with pointers to the actual positions in the audio files.
This will effectively hide away any unusable material so we don't have to bother with it anymore.

While evaluating a take we can add more information on the musical structure to the take object.
We can add metadata like time signature changes and particularly markers linking positions in the music (e.\,g.\ measures) to positions in the audio file.
Each new entry will increase the take's knowledge about the musical structure and will improve the interpolation of other positions.
This information is synchronized globally, so adding information to a take will increase the whole project's data coverage.
An application will be increasingly able to locate positions in audio files that correspond to a given musical moment.
Concretely this will allow the producer to ask for alternative takes, and the application can present all takes covering the given range and navigate to the respective positions for immediate playback.

\subsection{Storage and Version Control}

I suggest storing the information about the \emph{Take} objects in individual text files, one file for each take.
An application implementing my concept should transparently use plain text files and version control as its storage mechanism, for which I see several advantages%
\footnote{What I've written with regard to scholarly editing of scores (\url{http://lilypondblog.org/2013/07/plain-text-files-in-music/}) applies equally to the current context}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Undo/redo cannot only be \emph{unlimited} but also completely \emph{selective}.
\item There is an exhaustive \emph{project history} readily available to be presented in any desired form.
Commits are also a natural place to store meta information in their messages.
\item \emph{Branching} provides a way to always work in the context of an implicit session.
There is no need for “autosave”, because all changes are stored immediately to disk, so a program crash doesn't lose \emph{any} information.
Instead of “saving” at the end of the session the current branch is merged into master.
\item I'm sure one can make good use of branching to design workflows with “named sessions” (e.\,g.\ for trying out some hacks or to switch working context temporarily).
\item And of course this widely opens the door for \emph{collaborative workflows} where for example the musicians can evaluate takes while the editor is preparing his editing plan.
\end{itemize}

As we are talking of “atomic” commits the risk of running into merge conflicts at any point is rather small.
In a local set-up they could only happen when two or more “sessions” (i.\,e.\ branches) are open at the same time.
When working with remote repositories and multiple participants chances of running into conflicts are higher, but as all changes are written programmatically we know pretty well what is going on and can design simple and clean ways to resolve any conflicts.

However, this has to be absolutely transparent, and the ordinary user should not be required to learn \emph{any} versioning syntax or terminology.
Such a requirement would significantly reduce acceptance with the main target group.

\medskip
Instead of inventing a new plain text file format or using some form of \textsc{xml} I suggest using the LilyPond%
\footnote{\url{http://www.lilypond.org}}
input language as the format for take files.
We are talking about describing musical structures, and LilyPond offers a concise input language for just this.
It offers a natural way to add annotations through commands at \emph{musical} moments while it's easy to link those to file position through command arguments.
The LilyPond file format is very suitable for version control -- and we could even use LilyPond itself to “engrave” a final editing plan as a score.

\section{Outlining an Application}

As stated earlier I don't have any concrete plans with this, but I will outline a concept for a \textsc{gui} application as if I were going to start development soon.
Of course such a project can be realized with a wide range of tools, but if I were to start it I would go for a PyQt application.
Having some experience contributing to the Frescobaldi%
\footnote{\url{http://www.frescobaldi.org}}
LilyPond editor I think it is a very comfortable platform to work with -- and particularly the one I'm familiar with.

The main design issue I don't have a clear opinion about is the \emph{scope} of an application.
The only possible target in my eyes would be aiming at a tool that is used by professional recording producers -- creating yet another toy \textsc{daw} seems waste of time.
But while it seems fascinating to have a comprehensive \textsc{daw} using my new concepts it would probably be grossly negligent to try competing with all the existing \textsc{dsp} knowledge that already is on the market.
I currently see three options how to deal with this situation:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Find existing code that can be exploited, either in dedicated libraries or in open source software.
Of course this could limit the choice of programming languages.
\item Find an existing project that would be interested in incorporating the ideas into their \textsc{daw} system.
This would probably limit the choice of languages even more, but might compensate for this with existing experience and a framework.
\item Design the program as a standalone complementary tool, just like you'd have a bibliographic or indexing tool for authoring scholarly books.
This seems the most versatile option, and as it's the only one that is currently conceivable from my position I'll continue this paper with this option.
\end{itemize*}


\subsection{Intended Scope}

An application should provide a comprehensive set of tools to cover the whole process of managing the recorded material and preparing an edition plan.
There are other parts of the production process that seem too ambitious to tackle individually, and these should rather be realized by integrating existing tools as seamlessly as possible.
Amongst those are most notably the whole field of Digital Signal Processing, particularly recording/mixing and crossfade editing.
However, I will give these aspects some thought at the appropriate places.

The tasks our projected application should be able to perform and that I'll describe in the following sections are:
Accessing/importing and managing audio files,
annotating individual takes and the project structure, and
preparing and exporting the edition plan.

\subsection{Managing Audio Files}

The starting point for working on a musical production is the recorded audio material.
Our projected application would \emph{not} (at least for a start) try to implement a complete recording solution, instead we are going to simply \emph{use} existing audio material.

The simplest way to do so is to manage audio files by incorporating them through a symlink.
Combined with file system monitoring this would have the main advantage that the recording producer can use whatever tools she is used to (or has available).
When a file has been recorded within the other application it is automatically available in the pool of “our” application.

Of course it would be nice to be able to control recording from within our application, and probably it would also be manageable to implement a way to do this, e.\,g.\ using \texttt{arecord} and passing on the responsibility for audio setup to something else.
Another option -- although more restricted than desirable -- would be to use \textsc{osc} to remotely control \emph{Ardour}.

There is one thing to note here: Our program conceptually deals with audio mainly agnostic of a number of parallel tracks, a take is actually treated like a monophonic region.
I'm not sure if the program should really make a stereo mixdown for its working files or if it actually should playback a mix of all existing tracks.

\subsection{Annotating a Single Take}
The core element of our application is an editor for individual takes.
This is what we'll spend most of our time with, particularly during the initial evaluation of the recorded material.
Therefore this shouldn't be a dialog but a dockable panel which is permanently visible and simply gets updated with the currently focused take.
It contains a zoomable graphical representation of the audio in the take, very much like regions are usually displayed in \textsc{daw}s.
Playback controls should cover the usual range of features like moving forward and backward, listening to ranges, starting from marker positions etc.

This representation of a take is covered by a “timeline” which reflects the \emph{musical} structure.
That is it doesn't (primarily) display a time code but rather barlines, rests and time signatures, similar to a percussion staff.
Rehearsal marks, tempo indications and more may easily be added to this.
Initially (when we don't know more than the mere number of measures in the take) this musical structure consists of evenly spaced measures with a default time signature, but during work the editor can add relevant information such as time signature changes.
And she can set markers linking the musical structure to positions in the audio files.
Through this the program also gets an inherent understanding of tempo changes allowing it to interpolate positions for playback.
The timeline should visually distinguish between \emph{explicitly set} and \emph{interpolated} positions.

Information edited in an individual take will be propagated to the whole project and may be averaged with information from other takes.
This will deepen the project's knowledge about the musical structure and gradually improve the accuracy of position interpolations.
(You will recall that one of our goals is to make it possible to \emph{directly} access specific musical positions in takes.)
This means that when editing any given take the program will also take all the timing information into account that has been set in other takes covering the same musical range.

But of course the most relevant information added to takes is our evaluation.
It should be possible to assign ratings to any range or spot.
These ratings are given numerically, with some special values available for marking something as “unusable”, “usable as base material”, “suggested” or ”to be used” and “editing plan”.
Apart from numerical or tabular display the waveform representation could visualize this through differently colored background or similar means.
Adding ratings should be accessible through right-clicking on the waveform or through keyboard shortcuts while playing back.
Apart from the ratings one can add arbitrary verbal comments to the take as a whole, specific spots or regions or explicit ratings.

These ratings are stored in the LilyPond files with new appropriately designed commands.
The \emph{musical} position is defined by the position in the input file, while the position in the audio file is a mandatory argument of the commands.
This will ensure that the spots that are of particular interest are linked especially thoroughly.

It should be possible (but I'm not sure yet if it's worth the effort) to compile a score fragment with LilyPond, representing the musical structure and displaying the rating and comments in some way.

\subsection{Collaborative Workflows}

\textbf{TBD}

\subsection{Take List Overview}
Our application should have a panel that is quite similar to a \emph{Region List}, but with some unique features.
While traditional region lists display the project's regions sorted by the takes' original order or maybe by their position in the arrangement we have superior information availabe for this purpose, namely the information about the \emph{musical} content and our ratings.

The default sort order for takes in this list view would be their (musical) starting point, but depending on the current working perspective we can use different parameters for \emph{sorting} and \emph{filtering}.
For example when we're interested in a given musical moment we can hide all takes that don't cover this moment, and sort the remaining ones by their rating in descending order.
We can display the interesting moment as a cursor line and visualize the ratings -- this way we have an instant visual idea about the situation and possible alternative takes.

I won't list more ideas here (because that's something for the actual application design), but I'm sure you get the idea how this approach can dramatically increase productivity for the main task a recording producer has for editing classical music: preparing the editing plan.

\subsection{Editing Plan}
Conceptually an editing plan is a list of pairs with musical sections and references to takes.
Traditionally takes are only referenced as numbers because that's all we have to refer to.
But in our application we have significantly more: links from musical moments to positions in the audio files the takes are based on.
The precision of these links depends on the accuracy of our annotations, but generally one can expect that particularly the points actually interesting for transition between takes have been thoroughly examined.
Suggesting to add exact links to these points surely isn't much overhead, particularly given the advantage you gain by it.

With the knowledge our application has of the material we can easily display a list of takes that have ratings of at least “suggested”.
But even more interesting is the reversal: a list of musical ranges that \emph{don't} have takes with sufficient rating.
With these options we always have a clear picture of the progress of our editing plan, we see which parts of the composition still have to be resolved, and for the other parts we can see which alternative takes we may choose from.

In addition to a tabular representation this can be presented in a \textsc{ui} element quite similar to an arranger window.
The horizontal axis represents the timeline but is of course primarily structured musically.
The topmost “track” is reserved for the final editing plan, then there are tracks (or groups of tracks) for “to be used” or “suggested” takes, followed by a last area for all other takes.
Takes are presented as blocks (by default without waveform display but colored according to the rating) placed at their position in the piece.
This way one has a complete overview of the available recorded material, structured by relevance and quality through the assignment to tracks and by the color-coding.

When we're finished with our preparation -- that is the “editing plan” track is seamlessly filled with take fragments -- the editing plan can be exported: As a list with transition points and references to takes and positions in them, and possibly as a score (compiled by LilyPond) displaying the same information.
Additionally it would be nice to be able to export to \textsc{daw} programs' project files so one could for example open the result in Ardour and have the relevant takes already in the arranger window, ready to be finally edited.

\subsubsection{Transition Editor}
There is one more topic to consider, which would be more suitable for the final section of this paper but which is necessary to make a usable initial application: a \emph{Transition Editor}.

One crucial point when preparing an editing plan is not only to select usable takes for a given musical moment or range but also check if any considered transition between takes is actually possible.
Takes have to be compatible with respect to tempo, dynamics, internal balance and “atmosphere” (reverberation trails are particularly tricky) -- and this can only be tested by actually trying a transition.
Without such a feature even an initial application wouldn't be really usable.

Therefore I suggest to implement a rather simplistic Transition Editor which allows to position two takes relatively and offer simple options to edit the cross-fade.
From my experience this will be sufficient in most cases to judge if a given transition can be done later with a professional tool -- please refer to the last section of this paper for my thoughts on the future of this functionality.

By moving this to a dedicated tool we can avoid usability issues one usually has when working in an arranger window, particularly we can benefit from the fact that we're not bound by keeping in sync with a timeline.
So we don't have to scroll and zoom around to find and pull interesting takes to our current timeline position.
Instead (as we know about the links between musical structure and playback positions in the audio files) we can simply \emph{select} a desired take, which is then immediately present pre-cut at about the right point.
Imagine a dialog where you have a musical moment (e.\,g. “M.\,128, 3rd beat”) as the central reference point.
From a dropdown list you can then choose (for the “left” or “right” part of the transition) from all applicable takes, sorted by rating.
All this is self-contained and completely independent from the notion of a timeline.
The result of such an edit will simply be a usable transition which can be used in the editing plan (or put on a stash of usable transitions for later consideration).
If we have edited all transitions that are necessary to join the take fragments in the editing plan everything is there to render a preliminary first edit of the recording -- which will in most cases already be usable as a nice reference.
How this is actually managed and made accessible for a user interface will be a matter of concrete application design.



\section{Conclusions}

State only here that the Arranger Window is completely inappropriate?
